- Clicking on a painting (image element) opens a full-screen lightbox with a centered enlarged image.
- The background is dimmed to emphasize the artwork.
- Users can close the lightbox by:
  - Clicking the **X** close button in the corner.
- Navigation buttons (left and right arrows) are present in the modal to move through a gallery of all the images in enlarged size

**Accessibility:**

- The lightbox traps focus while open.
- The close button is keyboard-accessible and screen-reader friendly.

  - **Aâˆ’**: Decreases font size.

- These buttons adjust the font size of text on the page dynamically, without reloading.
